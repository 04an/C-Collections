# CSharpBP-Collections
Materials and starter files for the "C# Best Practices: Collections and Generics" Pluralsight course.

**NOTE: This sample code uses C# 6 and requires Visual Studio 2015.**
If you need to use this sample code with an earlier version of Visual Studio, let me know and I'll look into creating a version of the code that works with VS 2013.
